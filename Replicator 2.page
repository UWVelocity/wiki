# Printing Process

1. Design your model in Wings3D or other modelling software
2. Export your model to the .stl or .obj file format
3. Add the part (and potentially other parts) to a new thing in MakerWare
4. Layout and scale your parts in MakerWare, keeping in mind the info in the design considerations section
5. Export the file from MakerWare to a .x3g file, again keeping in mind the design considerations

# Design Considerations

Please add your own as you experiment and discover things!

## When designing parts in Wings3D or other software

- Avoid large holes or overhangs. These can bend over while the object is still printing, which makes the print fail at worst and look ugly at best. How large is bad? That will require some experimentation.

- Tall thin pieces might fall over during the print. Try to print as a flat wide piece instead.

## When laying out

- Place multiple parts close together to reduce build time

## When exporting

- Export for Replicator 2

- Increase layer height to reduce build time, but decrease quality

- Reduce number of shells to reduce build time, but decrease sturdiness. Use at least 2 shells

- The default temperature is 230, but some of the example parts use 240. I have also seen recommendations of 220. Don't go below 220, or above 250. I tend to use 235

- Add a raft to make parts easier to remove

- Add scaffolding to help hold up overhangs

## Terms

LMB - right mouse button
MMB - middle mouse button
RMB - right mouse button

Basic usage of Wings 3D: create a part using RMB and picking a basic shape (when in doubt, use a cube) then edit your model. If your model is symmetrical, use a virtual mirror (tools menu)
Use the information line in the bottom to get a feel for what is going on. When making a modification, press tab to use numeric input.

To change hotkeys, put your mouse on a command and press "/" then choose your key. Read the information line for more instructions.

## Changing your view

Move view around: MMB
Stop moving view: LMB
Focus on X: X
Focus on Y: Y
Focus on Z: Z
Switch to Wireframe mode: W
Center camera on selection: A

## Selecting things

Deselect all: Space
Select vertexes: V
Select edges: E
Select faces: F
Select bodies: B

Egde loop and edge ring are important ways to select, but require you to set your own hotkeys. I use L and R

## Modifying things

Almost all modification commands require you to set up your own hotkeys

## Modifying faces

Move normal: moves the face along its normal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal)
Move free: moves in the plane of the camera
Move X: moves in x direction, etc.
Most common move is move normal, so I made M the hotkey for that. 

Other modifications to experiment with:

Scale
Extrude
Intrude
Bevel
Bridge
Lift
Put on
Collapse (can interfere with edge loop/edge ring, try to avoid)
Smooth (usually select and entire body first)

## Modifying edges

Most edge modifications work best on an edge loop or edge ring

Slide
Connect (edge ring)
Circularize (edge loop)

## Modifying vertexes

Free move
Bevel

# Repair/Maintenance

The thermocouple can be disconnected. If this happens, remove the motherboard cover, and reconnect the adjacent red and yellow leads.
