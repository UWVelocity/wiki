If any founder is ever planning (or forsee) permanently relocating to the US, then make sure your company is a Delaware corporation.  CRA will charge you an exit tax on *unrealized* Canadian stock at its current market value.  A common scenario for this will be: Series A / B closes (valuing common stock at $m's), founder(s) relocate to SF / NY, go for visas on green card track.  Founder is stuck with a $$$ tax bill (and often before long-term capital gains rate kicks in!).

IANAL, but: if you want to maintain SRED, then have a Delaware corp that owns everything but the technical employees, and have an independent Canadian corporation that has 1 client, the Delaware corp, and runs at breakeven (so you can legitimately claim the Canadian corp has little value at exit).
