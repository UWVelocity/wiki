2.3	A Party’s involvement with the Project may terminate in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.
  
3	LICENSE AND ASSIGNMENT

3.1	Each Party hereby grants to each other Party, as of the Effective Date, an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, unrestricted, transferable, fully paid up, royalty-free and worldwide right to use, execute, copy, reproduce, develop, perform, make, produce, exploit, modify, maintain, sell, market, promote, distribute, export, import, transmit, broadcast, and sub-license such Party’s Individual IP to the extent reasonably needed by each other Party to further the Project.

3.2	To the extent allowed by law, the foregoing license shall be deemed to waive all rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as or referred to as “moral rights”, “artist's rights” or the like (collectively, the “Moral Rights”), and such Party hereby ratifies and consents to any action taken by the other Parties with respect to such Moral Rights in relation to the Project.

3.3	Each Party warrants that it has disclosed all existing and pending agreements and arrangements relating to the Individual IP, and also all third party interests, actual or potential, in and to the Individual IP, in Schedule A, and that they have obtained the written consent of all affected third parties to the license to the other Parties of its Individual IP in accordance with Section 3.1.

3.4	Each Party hereby undertakes to do and perform, sign, swear and execute all such further and other acts, deeds, documents, matters or things as may be required by the other Parties or considered necessary, desirable or proper (now or in the future) to give effect to the license of Individual IP set forth herein. 

3.5	Nothing herein shall be deemed to grant a license to any Individual IP of the other Parties to any Party leaving the Project or terminating their involvement in this Agreement, and such Party shall only have rights of ownership in and to their own Individual IP, subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.  Such Party acknowledges that their license grant of their Individual IP to the other Parties set forth in Section 3.1 above survives the termination of their participation in the Project and the Agreement.

4	PROJECT OBLIGATIONS

4.1	Each Party agrees that, in working on the Project:
a)	they shall take all necessary precautions to protect the integrity of the property, including the Individual IP, of the other Parties to this Agreement; 
b)	the performance of this Agreement shall not breach any other agreement entered into by such Party, including any prior employment or contractor agreement;
c)	they will not enter into any third-party agreements or grant any rights or licenses that conflict with those contemplated by this Agreement
d)	they will not use any confidential materials or documents of any former client or employer, or of any other third party, unless they have received prior written authorization to do so from the owner of the confidential materials or documents, and have informed the other Parties to this Agreement;
e)	to the best of their knowledge, no intellectual property rights of any third party shall be infringed by their Individual IP or their performance of this Agreement;
f)	they will immediately inform the other Parties of any actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against or adversely affecting, or which could adversely affect their Individual IP;
g)	they will immediately inform the other Parties of lien, charge, encumbrance or any other right of another against the Individual IP, or any prospect thereof.

4.2	Each Party acknowledges and agrees that nothing herein or related to the Project shall be deemed to create a legal partnership between the Parties, and that no Party has the right to bind any or all of the other Parties to any course of action or legal obligation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may, by unanimous consent, delegate any obligations with respect to the Project to a particular Party, by executing an authorization substantially in the form set forth in Schedule B.

5	NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION

5.1	Each Party agrees that it shall not, at any time during the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, directly or indirectly participate in any manner in the development of any product or intellectual property that competes in any way with the use, sale, licence, or application of the Project.  Where such Party has terminated its involvement in the Project and this Agreement and/or has otherwise ceased to be a Party to this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement, such prohibition shall continue for two (2) years after the date that such Party has terminated its involvement in the Project and this Agreement and/or has otherwise ceased to be a Party to this Agreement.  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the benefits obtained through this Agreement shall be sufficient consideration for the granting of this covenant.

5.2	Each Party agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, it will not in any way solicit, recruit, induce or attempt to influence any customer or prospective customer of the Project to terminate or reduce its relationship with the other Parties in relation to the Project (including without limitation by using knowledge gained from the Project, directly or indirectly, to support any competitive proposal to such customer or prospective customer).  The foregoing restriction shall not preclude a Party from soliciting or recruiting such customers or prospective customers for employment or other work after such Party is no longer involved in the Project, provided that: (i) such Party does not utilize any specific knowledge gained during their work on the Project in such solicitation or recruitment, and (ii) such solicitation or recruitment does not arise from, and is in no way connected to, Project opportunities with such customers or prospective customers of which such Party is, or should reasonably be, aware (whether past, current or future).

5.3	Each Party acknowledges that a breach of this provision would cause irreparable harm to the other Parties, and that any other Party is therefore entitled to a permanent and interlocutory injunction prohibiting such Party from engaging in such activity upon reasonable apprehension of such breach.  Each Party confirms that the obligations set out in this Section 5 are fair and reasonable, and that, given such Party’s general knowledge and experience, they will not preclude such Party from operating in such Party’s industry or field of expertise.

6	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

6.1	Any intellectual property registrations respecting the Intellectual Property shall be the responsibility of the individual Parties creating the Intellectual Property.  Where more than one Party has created the Intellectual Property being registered, the registering Party must ensure that all creators of the Intellectual Property are jointly registered as owners, creators and authors of such Intellectual Property, and each Party listed shall jointly bear the responsibility for the costs and expenses of registering and maintaining such registrations; provided however that if a Party does not wish to be included in such registration, they shall not be obligated to bear such costs and expenses, and shall waive all rights to be listed and to benefit as an owner, creator or author of such Intellectual Property being registered.

7	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 

7.1	Each Party agrees that at all times during the term of this Agreement and at all times following termination of this Agreement, whether voluntary or involuntary:
a)	they shall maintain all Confidential Information in strict confidence, shall take all necessary precautions against unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information, and shall not directly or indirectly, disclose, allow access to, transmit or transfer any Confidential Information to a third party without the knowledge and express written consent of the other Parties;
b)	they shall not use, disclose or reproduce the Confidential Information except as reasonably required in working on the Project and with the knowledge and express consent of the other Parties;
c)	they shall advise the other Parties immediately in writing of any misappropriation, disclosure, conversion or misuse by any person of any Confidential Information of which they may become aware;
d)	all Confidential Information shall be clearly marked and noted as being “Proprietary and Confidential Information” of the Party providing the information, or, if the Parties so wish, of the Project.
e)	upon the earlier of a request by the other Parties or the termination of such Party’s involvement with this Agreement (whether voluntary or involuntary), such Party shall immediately return to the other Parties all Confidential Information and all documents and data relating to the Project which are in such Party’s possession or control.

7.2	Each Party specifically acknowledges and agrees that damages may not be an adequate remedy to compensate the other Parties for any breach of such Party’s obligations contained herein, and accordingly such Party agrees that in addition to any and all other remedies available, any or all of the other Parties shall be entitled to obtain relief by way of a temporary or permanent injunction to enforce these obligations.

7.3	The non-disclosure obligations under this Agreement shall not apply to Confidential Information which a Party can establish:
a)	is, or becomes, readily available to the public other than through a breach of this Agreement;
b)	was disclosed, lawfully and without breach of any contractual or other legal obligation, to such Party by a third party without any confidentiality obligation attached to such information;
c)	was lawfully known to such Party without any confidentiality obligation attached thereto; or
d)	was independently developed or discovered by such Party outside of the course of such Party’s performance of their obligations under this Agreement, without any reference to any Confidential Information obtained directly or indirectly from the Project.

8	WARRANTIES

8.1	Each Party warrants that:
a)	they have the full power to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder;
b)	they will observe and comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, codes and regulations of governmental agencies, including federal, provincial, state, municipal and local governing bodies, of any country having jurisdiction over this Agreement or any part thereof; and
c)	they have the absolute right to grant the licenses and make the assignments of the right, title and interest in and to the Individual IP contemplated in this Agreement.

9	INDEMNITY AND LIABILITY

9.1	Each Party shall indemnify and hold harmless all the other Parties from and against any and all damages, injuries, claims, demands, actions, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred or made against any or all of the other Parties arising from or connected with: (a) a breach of any warranty, representation or covenant herein by such Party, (b) the negligence or willful misconduct of such Party, or (c) a third party claim that such Party’s Individual IP infringes or misappropriates any patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets or other proprietary rights.  No Party shall be obligated to indemnify any other Party to the limited extent that a claim directly results from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Agreement of or by such other Party.

9.2	No Party shall enter into any settlement that would adversely affect any other Party’s rights hereunder, or impose any obligations on any other Party in addition to those set forth herein, without the affected Party’s prior written consent.

9.3	Each Party will promptly notify the other Parties of any claims for which such Party is obligated to indemnify any other Party hereunder, and all Parties will cooperate fully in the defense of all claims hereunder.  Each Party may, at its own cost and expense, actively participate in any proceeding that is subject to the indemnity hereunder utilizing its own legal counsel.

10	TERM AND TERMINATION

10.1	The term of this Agreement shall be two (2) years from the Effective Date, and shall automatically renew on an annual basis until and unless terminated in accordance with the provisions herein.

10.2	Any Party shall be entitled to terminate their involvement in the Project and their participation in this Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other Parties.  

10.3	The Parties may terminate the involvement in the Project and the participation in this Agreement of any Party by a meeting of all the Parties, and the casting of a vote, or, in lieu of such a meeting and vote, the express written response of all the Parties to a notice sent to all Parties setting out the decision to be made.  Where the majority of such votes or responses (being over 50% of the Parties) is in favour of the termination of such Party’s involvement in the Project and participation in this Agreement, such Party shall cease to be a Party to this Agreement, and their involvement in the Project and participation in this Agreement shall be deemed terminated.

10.4	This Agreement shall terminate upon the incorporation of a company by the Parties to effect the commercialization of the Project; however, each Party acknowledges that their license grant of their Individual IP to the other Parties set forth in Section 3.1 above shall be automatically transferred to such corporation, together with all their obligations, warranties and representations herein, and shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

10.5	This Agreement may be terminated upon the unanimous written consent of all Parties hereto.

10.6	Any provision of this Agreement which expressly states that it is to continue in effect after termination or expiration of this Agreement, or which by its nature would survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall do so.  For greater certainty, the provisions relating to non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and indemnity shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement, for any reason.

11	GENERAL

11.1	Independent Contractors.  Each Party shall perform its obligations hereunder as an independent contractor, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create or imply a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent, or employment relationship between the Parties.

11.2	Notices:  Any notices, reports or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sufficient if delivered by hand or sent by registered mail, courier or facsimile addressed to a Party at their address appearing in this Agreement, or to such other address as a Party may advise the other Parties in writing.  Any such notices, reports, or other communications shall be deemed to have been received by the Party to whom they were addressed: (a) upon delivery by hand, (b) five (5) business days after being sent by registered mail, (c) upon delivery by courier, as evidenced by the courier receipt, or (d) upon successful receipt of a confirmation report after being sent by facsimile.

11.3	Time/No Waiver:  Time is of the essence of this Agreement.  No waiver by a Party of a breach or omission by any other Party under this Agreement shall be binding on the waiving Party unless it is expressly made in writing and signed by the waiving Party.  Any waiver by a Party of a particular breach or omission by any other Party shall not affect or impair the rights of the waiving Party in respect of any subsequent breach or omission of the same or different kind.

11.4	Assignment: No Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder to any third party without the express, prior written consent of all other Parties hereto.

11.5	Severability:  If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, any such provision shall be severable from this Agreement, in which event this Agreement shall be construed as if such provision had never been contained herein.

11.6	Governing Law:  The Parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any dispute that may arise under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, each Party shall have the right to pursue any right or remedy available to it in law or in equity.  This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, excluding rules of private international law that lead to the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.  The courts of Ontario shall have the non-exclusive jurisdiction to hear any matter arising in connection with this Agreement.

11.7	Entire Agreement/Modification: This Agreement and the accompanying Schedules constitute the entire agreement between the Parties and supersede all previous agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

11.8	Counterparts:  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, or facsimile counterparts, each of which when executed by the Parties shall be deemed to be an original and such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.
