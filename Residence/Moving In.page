## Getting Started

Welcome to VeloCity Residence!

Pick up your keys at the **V1 Front Desk**. You will need your WatCard. You will receive three keys: a small one for your mailbox, a larger one for your room, and a HID (Contactless) card to enter the building and the floors.

If your HID (Contactless) card is has a broken hook or does not open the doors, go back to the V1 Front Desk and ask for a new one. If you bring in the old one, they should be willing to replace it without a fee.

Your don(s) will likely hold a meeting on the first night of term to discuss the usual yada, yada. It's boring, but try to attend as the social norms at VeloCity are slightly different from those of other residences. This meeting is separate from the rest of the VeloCity programming in the first week. (The Dons fall under Housing & Residences, where as the VeloCity program falls under the Student Success Office.)

You'll only get as much out of living in the residence as you put in. Go to as many VeloCity events as you can. Build stuff, and don't be afraid to throw away your work and start over. If something pisses you off about the residence, do something about it!
