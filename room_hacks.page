List of Room Hacks:

- Standing desk by putting my coffee table (from home) on top of the desk.
- Move the reading lamp to be by the door, attached to the light at the top. Shining it on the ceiling makes for sweet ambient light.
- Removing the wood from under your mattress makes it cushier (but louder ;) ).
- Your bedside desk & desk are about the same height. Take the wood from under your mattress and lay it accross both to make a (light-duty) desk.
- If your desk faces the window (and the heater is by your feet), take off the mosquito mat, and lay it over the hole by the grille. It prevents everything from rolling onto the floor.
