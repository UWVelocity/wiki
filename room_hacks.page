List of Room Hacks:

- You can make a ghetto standing desk by putting a coffee table (from home) on top of the desk.
- For ambient light, move the reading lamp to be by the sink, attached to the light directly above. Shining it on the ceiling makes for great ambient light.
- Removing the wood from under your mattress makes it cushier (but louder if you use your bed ;. (Leaving the wood under also makes the bed slide if you use it ;))
- To have an extra (light-duty) desk, take your bedside desk & "actual" desk and lay the wood from under your mattress across both. The two are within 2-3 textbooks of the same height.
- If your desk faces the window (and the heater is by your feet), take off the screen from your window, and lay it over the hole by the heater. It prevents things on your desk from rolling onto the floor.
- To have more space, put your fridge in the closet, if you don't have a lot of clothes that need to hang.
