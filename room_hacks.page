List of Room Hacks:

- You can make a ghetto standing desk by putting a coffee table (from home) on top of the desk.
- For ambient light, move the reading lamp to be by the sink, attached to the light directly above. Shining it on the ceiling makes for great ambient light.
- Removing the wood from under your mattress makes it cushier (but louder if you use your bed ;) ).
- Your bedside desk & "actual" desk are about the same height. Take the wood from under your mattress and lay it across both to make a (light-duty) desk.
- If your desk faces the window (and the heater is by your feet), take off the bug mat, and lay it over the hole by the heater. It prevents things on your desk from rolling onto the floor.
