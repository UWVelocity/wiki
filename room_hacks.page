List of Room Hacks:

- You can make a ghetto standing desk by putting a coffee table (from home), or one of the provided recycling bins on top of the desk.
- For ambient light, move the reading lamp to be by the sink, attached to the light directly above. Shining it on the ceiling makes for great ambient light.
- The reading lamp can also be attached to the bookcase to make a better night-light.
- Removing the wood from under your mattress makes it cushier (but louder).
- To have an extra (light-duty) desk, take your bedside table and "actual" desk, then lay the wood from under your mattress across both. The two are within 2-3 textbooks of the same height.
- If you have a larger room (your desk faces the window and the heater is by your feet), take off the screen from your window, and lay it over the hole by the heater. It prevents things on your desk from rolling onto the floor.
- To have more space, put your fridge in the closet, if you don't have a lot of clothes that need to hang.
- Alternatively, put your fridge on top of the 'bedside table'.
