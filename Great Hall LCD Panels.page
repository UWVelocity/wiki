There's an old Windows XP machine sitting in a cabinet next to the "bar" in the Great Hall. It runs proprietary software that drives the LCDs. For most people, this is sufficient. Please keep patterns/images tasteful.

Said Windows XP machine must be kept off the wired network, because it stops working otherwise. It is connected to a really old Gentoo box that is then connected to the boxes (near the back door) that actually drive the lights.
