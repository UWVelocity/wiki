Printer setup for Windows and Mac OS X

1. Download the drivers on Xerox.com for the [WorkCentre 7535 printer](http://www.support.xerox.com/support/workcentre-7545-7556/downloads/enus.html?operatingSystem=macosx109&associatedProduct=XRIP_WC7525_base). Download the most recent driver.

2. Install the drivers and during the printer set up process of the installer add the printer using the IP address option (icon on the right) with the IP address 172.20.5.242 and ensure that the software finds the printer.

 

There will be no printer codes given out like we do in the Garage but the same rules apply.  Please do not take advantage of the system by printing a million pages a day.  If any problems with over use of the printer come up we will have to change to a print credit system, which we would like to avoid!
