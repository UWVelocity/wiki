We currently have one barbecue:

It is a [Master Chef E480](http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/2/OutdoorLiving/BBQs/PropaneBBQs/PRD~0853040P/Master+Chef+E480+Propane+BBQ%2BGrill.jsp?locale=en), sponsored by Encircle. If the propane tank is getting low, email <mh.reslife@uwaterloo.ca> and Housing will co-ordinate for it to be filled up. There is a set of cooking/cleaning tools available (inside the barbecue, next to the propane tank), and we ask that you please try to keep it in good shape. Also note that you need to light burner number 3 first using the sparker, and only then turn the other burners on (so to light up everything, turn number 3 on, use sparker to light it, turn 2 & 4 on, and then turn 1 on). Please also cover the barbecue after use (once it's cooled down).
