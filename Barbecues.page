We have 3 barbecues:

The first two are provided by Housing and are in terrible shape. They still do work, and housing will refill their tanks as needed.

The third is a [Master Chef E480](http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/2/OutdoorLiving/BBQs/PropaneBBQs/PRD~0853040P/Master+Chef+E480+Propane+BBQ%2BGrill.jsp?locale=en), sponsored by Quikasyst. Housing does not provide anything for its use, although there is a set of cooking/cleaning tools available (Inside the barbecue, next to the propane tank) and I'll try to keep the propane full. Please try to keep it in good shape. Also note that you need to light burner number 3 first using the sparker, and only then turn the other burners on (so to light up everything, turn number 3 on, use sparker to light it, turn 2 & 4 on, and then turn 1 on).
