There are two separate wired networks in the residence:

- The resnet network that you can access from your room.
- The common network, composed of the wall plugs in the Great Hall, Device Lab & Conference Room, and the 'Christophe' wireless network.

They are completely separate, and maintained by different people entirely.

# Troubleshooting
If the internet access on the Christophe wireless network breaks (this occurs often), take the white D-Link router below the TV and unplug/replug its power cable. If problems persist, or if the wired common network breaks, inform christophe.biocca@gmail.com
