As with everything, don't take everything here as the truth, but as points to consider. There are always exceptions.

Paul Graham runs YC, and [his essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) are great. Some really good ones include:

- [A Student's Guide to Startups](http://paulgraham.com/mit.html)
- [What Startups are really like](http://paulgraham.com/really.html)
- [How to Start a Startup](http://paulgraham.com/start.html)
- [How not to Die](http://paulgraham.com/die.html)

Great article on understanding who to ask for help.

- [Talk to founders who failed at what you are doing](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2013/01/go-talk-to-founders-who-failed-at-what-youre-doing.html)
