You've probably seen the screens in the entrance and the great hall. They're essentially displaying the contents of [displays.velocityresidence.com](http://displays.velocityresidence.com), which rotates between a bunch of websites. The code is hosted [on the UWVelocity github organization](https://github.com/UWVelocity/Velocity-Displays).

If you want to add a website, or have a suggestion for what kind of content to show, [email me](mailto:christophe.biocca@gmail.com) or add a suggestion below:
