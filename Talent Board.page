## Neeraj Raghuram ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am an entrepreneur at heart and have a deep passion for developing new products.   As a recent graduate in mechanical engineering from the University of Waterloo and a keen interest in working for and developing a start-up business, I am seeking a volunteer or a full time/part time position. 

  Through my fourth year design project: an “automated garden weed extracting device”, my group and I were able to identify a new market opportunity, design a product and successfully build and operate it. This project made me go outside my comfort zone of mechanical design and helped me gain knowledge of electrical circuits, android application development and programming of micro-controllers. My project was selected for a case study for three Mechatronics Engineering Courses at the University of Waterloo.   My fourth year design project has helped me gain extensive experience in market opportunity identification, concept development and selection, prototyping and testing.

Technical skills along with my communication skills will make me an excellent fit for your start-up.  I feel certain that my dedication and desire to learn, coupled with a commitment to excellence, will allow me to contribute to your organization. I hope to have the opportunity to talk about a possible position in more detail. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have.

## Edward Squire ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

 I am a successful business man currently running my second business (employing 100+). It is not a tech related business. As an entrepreneur, I am in the process of self-funding a mobile app. I am confident that this has significant upside potential and feel it most prudent that I begin to involve a tech advisor so as to best strategize and unlock the full potential.
 
   I feel that it is most prudent that I begin to collaborate with an individual with a different yet complimentary business perspective (than my own). Someone with a strong entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in a collaborative environment and is excited & eager to participate in the early stages of a potentially significant opportunity.  I am looking for an experienced tech entrepreneur that would be willing to learn more about this app and possibly take some equity in return for active advice and counsel? (or college student with background & experience that might relate to this type of project)

## Loshanah Shakthivel ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup? 

I have my own start-up on the way and I thought I can contribute by providing any assistance for those also starting up. I think the best way to look at it is that no one is an expert on start-ups and entrepreneurship because even those who have made success in the past, can fail today. That's why, even a beginner like me who aspires to one day launch my company in the near future can give tips and work around with those who think like me.
