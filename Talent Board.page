How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I believe that my enthusiasm and eagerness to learn is my biggest strength. It motivates me to work hard and tackle any problem. I have a programming background but I yet have a lot to learn and I know that volunteering at Velocity will allow me to gain a lot of experience and knowledge and do something that I am passionate about. Maybe volunteering at Velocity may spark an idea in me to start a startup that tackles a problem we are faced in the society because my career goal is not only to create something innovative but something that strives to make an impact in our society.

## Sarah Zhang 04/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I will bring to Velocity a new approach to problem solving. I have exceptional analytical and critical thinking skills which were developed through my experiences on a competitive math team. I approach problems unconventionally and use creativity to find solutions which is extremely important in a startup environment. I also bring a superior work ethic and a drive to constantly improve upon myself. As a result, with any tasks I am given, I apply myself 100% to enhance the learning experience and produce work of exceptional quality. I also bring extensive volunteering experience spanning from bookkeeping to a local optical boutique to assistant camp counselor to working as a sales associate at Music Plus Corporation. These experiences have thrown me into various situations and have allowed me to develop a problem solving acumen.

## Rahul Dutta 07/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

My Business course at Western has enhanced my skills in problem solving, strategic thinking and analysis; case study style teaching gave me the opportunity to solve real-life problems faced by companies in the fields such as finance, marketing and investing. A course requirement was to, in a group of 7, come up with an entrepreneurial venture and investigate its feasibility. We analyzed the market, customers, competitors, industry, marketing strategies and produced financial projections for the first 3 years of operations using various Excel functions, for which I was responsible.

I strongly believe that this experience, along with my intense passion for entrepreneurship and the new ideas that will naturally occur from a fresh mind, will have a positive impact at Velocity Garage.

## Spencer Charles 22/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am willing to work or volunteer for anyone that could use the help. I am available part time from now until the end of August, after which I will be on a Co-op term, then I will be available again in subsequent terms. I have experience working in a successful start up; having just completed a Co-op term as the Office Manager at Depth Training and Physiotherapy, where I am currently working part-time. I was fortunate to be the first employee in this position; as such I was highly involved in shaping its roles and responsibilities. As a result I am very comfortable working in agile team environments with little to no supervision.

## Anna Dong 25/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am currently a biomedical engineering student studying at the University of Waterloo. My background in engineering and biology will allow me to approach problems from both point of views. I have programming, designing, prototyping and laboratory experiences. In addition, I am an enthusiastic individual that will bring a lot of creative ideas to the team.

## Geoff Camp 25/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am very goal oriented and motivated. Once I have my sights set on something I want to accomplish I don't let task related or unrelated problems distract or derail me from accomplishing my goals. I think this mind set will help in a volunteer position at a startup as long hours are required for no compensation; factors that could easily distract someone who wasn't 100% commited. On a more concrete note, I have completed a bachelors in engineering at U of G. I think the acquired soft skills from that experience will propel me through all the learning required to contribute to a startup in a volunteer position. I also like to think i'm pretty good at coding.

## David Dowhaniuk 25/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am an experienced media artist, designer and technologist. I recently completed my MSc in Digital Media in the joint program at the University of Bremen and University of the Arts Bremen.
I have a passion for UX research and ensuring the resulting implementation represents the collected data. As an art researcher I am interesting in new ways of representing biometric data which is aimed not at medical professionals but patients and their loved ones. I am also very interested in the areas of inclusive design and eLearning.

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am a hard working individual with experience completing tasks on time and efficiently. I feel that the values encompassed in Velocity align with my own ideals. That through the fostering of community and creativity we can elevate what we have been taught here at Waterloo.
