How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I believe that my enthusiasm and eagerness to learn is my biggest strength. It motivates me to work hard and tackle any problem. I have a programming background but I yet have a lot to learn and I know that volunteering at Velocity will allow me to gain a lot of experience and knowledge and do something that I am passionate about. Maybe volunteering at Velocity may spark an idea in me to start a startup that tackles a problem we are faced in the society because my career goal is not only to create something innovative but something that strives to make an impact in our society.

## Sarah Zhang 04/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I will bring to Velocity a new approach to problem solving. I have exceptional analytical and critical thinking skills which were developed through my experiences on a competitive math team. I approach problems unconventionally and use creativity to find solutions which is extremely important in a startup environment. I also bring a superior work ethic and a drive to constantly improve upon myself. As a result, with any tasks I am given, I apply myself 100% to enhance the learning experience and produce work of exceptional quality. I also bring extensive volunteering experience spanning from bookkeeping to a local optical boutique to assistant camp counselor to working as a sales associate at Music Plus Corporation. These experiences have thrown me into various situations and have allowed me to develop a problem solving acumen.

## Rahul Dutta 07/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

My Business course at Western has enhanced my skills in problem solving, strategic thinking and analysis; case study style teaching gave me the opportunity to solve real-life problems faced by companies in the fields such as finance, marketing and investing. A course requirement was to, in a group of 7, come up with an entrepreneurial venture and investigate its feasibility. We analyzed the market, customers, competitors, industry, marketing strategies and produced financial projections for the first 3 years of operations using various Excel functions, for which I was responsible.

I strongly believe that this experience, along with my intense passion for entrepreneurship and the new ideas that will naturally occur from a fresh mind, will have a positive impact at Velocity Garage.

## Spencer Charles 22/05/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am willing to work or volunteer for anyone that could use the help. I am available part time from now until the end of August, after which I will be on a Co-op term, then I will be available again in subsequent terms. I have experience working in a successful start up; having just completed a Co-op term as the Office Manager at Depth Training and Physiotherapy, where I am currently working part-time. I was fortunate to be the first employee in this position; as such I was highly involved in shaping its roles and responsibilities. As a result I am very comfortable working in agile team environments with little to no supervision.
