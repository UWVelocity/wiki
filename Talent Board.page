How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

As a life long entrepreneur I enjoy the energy and challenge of starting a business and am willing to contribute my time and resources in assisting others to be successful. 

Having built Canada's largest distribution/manufacturing company in combat sports and built several successful brands I have exposure to various aspects of business development. Aside from having knowledge of all aspects of small business, I have expertise in soft good manufacturing, marketing, brand building, online sales, import/export and distribution. I consider myself creative and enthusiastic. As a former Canadian Olympian I also have developed many skills in balancing life, managing challenges and attaining goals.

## Yash Shah 23/04/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I believe that my enthusiasm and eagerness to learn is my biggest strength. It motivates me to work hard and tackle any problem. I have a programming background but I yet have a lot to learn and I know that volunteering at Velocity will allow me to gain a lot of experience and knowledge and do something that I am passionate about. Maybe volunteering at Velocity may spark an idea in me to start a startup that tackles a problem we are faced in the society because my career goal is not only to create something innovative but something that strives to make an impact in our society.

## Sarah Zhang 04/05/2015 ##

I will bring to Velocity a new approach to problem solving. I have exceptional analytical and critical thinking skills which were developed through my experiences on a competitive math team. I approach problems unconventionally and use creativity to find solutions which is extremely important in a startup environment. I also bring a superior work ethic and a drive to constantly improve upon myself. As a result, with any tasks I am given, I apply myself 100% to enhance the learning experience and produce work of exceptional quality. I also bring extensive volunteering experience spanning from bookkeeping to a local optical boutique to assistant camp counselor to working as a sales associate at Music Plus Corporation. These experiences have thrown me into various situations and have allowed me to develop a problem solving acumen.
