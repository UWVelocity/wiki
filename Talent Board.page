## Marie Rosszell ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I have been part of the Launchpad at Communitech for a year now, and launched a social venture -'R Space, last January with two of my business partners. I am the CMO for the venture, being responsible for the marketing materials, social media, as well as promotions we conduct to increase awareness and attract more customers. My experience with 'R Space has not only exposed me to marketing, but it has also taught me the importance of adaptability; that in startups, you are required to do more than what the job description states. There were difficult times where we doubted ourselves, not being able to see the light at the end, but we pulled through, which taught me the importance of never giving up on things that really matter to you. I have also worked as an Online Marketing Co-op this summer, which has given we exposure to the field of Online Marketing. Although I am open to different opportunities, I believe I would be able to contribute the most in the field of marketing. I am also an international student from Japan, so any venture working towards expanding into Japan, or neighbour countries, I would be capable of assisting them with overcoming cultural barriers.

I enjoy working in a startups because of the opportunity you have to create something from scratch, and the passion and energy the team has. Yes -it is tougher than working in corporate, but I believe I will be able to bring my passion, experience and skill set to help the venture to reach its maximum potential.

## Rudder Zhang ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

My strengths and experiences are focused in public accounting and capital markets. Through my 2 coop terms at Price Waterhouse Coopers in Audit and Assurance, I've developed an in-depth understanding of financial accounting and are familiar with the two accepted accounting frameworks used by public and private companies in Canada. I believe I can contribute to a startup through financial budgeting, record-keeping, and analysis.

However, my most important skills are the ones I've developed recently through my leadership with the Student-Run Investment Fund with the School of Accounting and Finance, which will be further developed in my next coop term in Investment Banking with Goldman Sachs Toronto. I've trained outstanding presentation, communication, teamwork, and financial analysis skills through stock pitches, valuations, and investment decisions. I can contribute to a startup by helping hone presentation ideas and pitches and prepare marketing materials to potential investors.

## Neeraj Raghuram ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am an entrepreneur at heart and have a deep passion for developing new products.   As a recent graduate in mechanical engineering from the University of Waterloo and a keen interest in working for and developing a start-up business, I am seeking a volunteer or a full time/part time position. 

  Through my fourth year design project: an “automated garden weed extracting device”, my group and I were able to identify a new market opportunity, design a product and successfully build and operate it. This project made me go outside my comfort zone of mechanical design and helped me gain knowledge of electrical circuits, android application development and programming of micro-controllers. My project was selected for a case study for three Mechatronics Engineering Courses at the University of Waterloo.   My fourth year design project has helped me gain extensive experience in market opportunity identification, concept development and selection, prototyping and testing.

Technical skills along with my communication skills will make me an excellent fit for your start-up.  I feel certain that my dedication and desire to learn, coupled with a commitment to excellence, will allow me to contribute to your organization. I hope to have the opportunity to talk about a possible position in more detail. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have.

## Edward Squire ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

 I am a successful business man currently running my second business (employing 100+). It is not a tech related business. As an entrepreneur, I am in the process of self-funding a mobile app. I am confident that this has significant upside potential and feel it most prudent that I begin to involve a tech advisor so as to best strategize and unlock the full potential.
 
   I feel that it is most prudent that I begin to collaborate with an individual with a different yet complimentary business perspective (than my own). Someone with a strong entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in a collaborative environment and is excited & eager to participate in the early stages of a potentially significant opportunity.  I am looking for an experienced tech entrepreneur that would be willing to learn more about this app and possibly take some equity in return for active advice and counsel? (or college student with background & experience that might relate to this type of project)

I am a hustler who loves ideas, innovation, and a challenge. I also love to learn and believe that my creativity, determination, and problem solving skills would be an asset to any team.

## Karan Huynh ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I feel as though a little back story is required for me to answer this question. I am in my 2A term studying computer science. I took computer science on a whim in high school, programming in C#, instantly found a liking towards it, leading to where I am today. I loved the creativity that it brought as well as the right and wrong logic that the code brings. Upon entering Waterloo first year I learned Scheme which is a dead language that is unknown to the realm of computer science languages. It is a functional language when I was used to the object oriented programming I did in high school. In high school, I was able to make games and see the potential in my programming skills whereas the only programming I am currently doing is for class. Currently, I feel very limited in terms of my practical programing experiences and I do not like it. I self taught myself Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, SQL, Ruby, jQuery, and PHP, during this past summer via codecademy.com because I wanted to broaden my computer science portfolio and get back into the computer science I fell in love with in high school. I am not going to lie and say that I am an expert at these languages, hell no, but I would like to learn more. Given that I took the initiative to learn these languages on my spare time along with the fact that I am applying to be a volunteer at velocity, I hope that it shows that I am eager to learn and am willing to put in the effort to do so. I want to be able to apply the skills I know towards velocity and simply contribute as a female in computer science who is eager to learn by doing and wants to do whatever she is appointed to do. On a side note, I am very easy to talk to and have an overly optimistic personality. You will enjoy my presence, I guarantee that. That was confidence, not cockiness (: I should also throw in the fact that I always get my shit done when it needs to be done.
