How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

To Whom it May Concern,
My name is Jesse Sharpe. I'm a fourth year Knowledge Integration student at the University of Waterloo with a peaking interest in entrepreneurship. After looking through Velocity's website, I have found myself excited about the many opportunities offered through Velocity, and would love to plug-in to learn more about the start-up culture and entrepreneurship in general. You will find my cover letter and resume attached. Please take a moment to view my credentials and experience, as I would be excited to offer all that I can to our local start-up community! I have references available upon request. Thank you for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day!

Resume: 

== Edward Squire ==

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

 I am a successful business man currently running my second business (employing 100+). It is not a tech related business. As an entrepreneur, I am in the process of self-funding a mobile app. I am confident that this has significant upside potential and feel it most prudent that I begin to involve a tech advisor so as to best strategize and unlock the full potential.
 
   I feel that it is most prudent that I begin to collaborate with an individual with a different yet complimentary business perspective (than my own). Someone with a strong entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in a collaborative environment and is excited & eager to participate in the early stages of a potentially significant opportunity.  I am looking for an experienced tech entrepreneur that would be willing to learn more about this app and possibly take some equity in return for active advice and counsel? (or college student with background & experience that might relate to this type of project)
