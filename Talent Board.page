## Sarah Zhang 04/05/2015 ##

I will bring to Velocity a new approach to problem solving. I have exceptional analytical and critical thinking skills which were developed through my experiences on a competitive math team. I approach problems unconventionally and use creativity to find solutions which is extremely important in a startup environment. I also bring a superior work ethic and a drive to constantly improve upon myself. As a result, with any tasks I am given, I apply myself 100% to enhance the learning experience and produce work of exceptional quality. I also bring extensive volunteering experience spanning from bookkeeping to a local optical boutique to assistant camp counselor to working as a sales associate at Music Plus Corporation. These experiences have thrown me into various situations and have allowed me to develop a problem solving acumen.
