## Neeraj Raghuram ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am an entrepreneur at heart and have a deep passion for developing new products.   As a recent graduate in mechanical engineering from the University of Waterloo and a keen interest in working for and developing a start-up business, I am seeking a volunteer or a full time/part time position. 

  Through my fourth year design project: an “automated garden weed extracting device”, my group and I were able to identify a new market opportunity, design a product and successfully build and operate it. This project made me go outside my comfort zone of mechanical design and helped me gain knowledge of electrical circuits, android application development and programming of micro-controllers. My project was selected for a case study for three Mechatronics Engineering Courses at the University of Waterloo.   My fourth year design project has helped me gain extensive experience in market opportunity identification, concept development and selection, prototyping and testing.

Technical skills along with my communication skills will make me an excellent fit for your start-up.  I feel certain that my dedication and desire to learn, coupled with a commitment to excellence, will allow me to contribute to your organization. I hope to have the opportunity to talk about a possible position in more detail. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have.

## Edward Squire ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

 I am a successful business man currently running my second business (employing 100+). It is not a tech related business. As an entrepreneur, I am in the process of self-funding a mobile app. I am confident that this has significant upside potential and feel it most prudent that I begin to involve a tech advisor so as to best strategize and unlock the full potential.
 
   I feel that it is most prudent that I begin to collaborate with an individual with a different yet complimentary business perspective (than my own). Someone with a strong entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in a collaborative environment and is excited & eager to participate in the early stages of a potentially significant opportunity.  I am looking for an experienced tech entrepreneur that would be willing to learn more about this app and possibly take some equity in return for active advice and counsel? (or college student with background & experience that might relate to this type of project)

## Andreea Fatu ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I am a hustler who loves ideas, innovation, and a challenge. I also love to learn and believe that my creativity, determination, and problem solving skills would be an asset to any team. My wide-ranging experiences from audit to project management would be skills that a startup (who needs people to wear multiple hats) would appreciate. I also have my own start-up so I know what it's like to start (and more importantly grow) a business.

## Karan Huynh ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I feel as though a little back story is required for me to answer this question. I am in my 2A term studying computer science. I took computer science on a whim in high school, programming in C#, instantly found a liking towards it, leading to where I am today. I loved the creativity that it brought as well as the right and wrong logic that the code brings. Upon entering Waterloo first year I learned Scheme which is a dead language that is unknown to the realm of computer science languages. It is a functional language when I was used to the object oriented programming I did in high school. In high school, I was able to make games and see the potential in my programming skills whereas the only programming I am currently doing is for class. Currently, I feel very limited in terms of my practical programing experiences and I do not like it. I self taught myself Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, SQL, Ruby, jQuery, and PHP, during this past summer via codecademy.com because I wanted to broaden my computer science portfolio and get back into the computer science I fell in love with in high school. I am not going to lie and say that I am an expert at these languages, hell no, but I would like to learn more. Given that I took the initiative to learn these languages on my spare time along with the fact that I am applying to be a volunteer at velocity, I hope that it shows that I am eager to learn and am willing to put in the effort to do so. I want to be able to apply the skills I know towards velocity and simply contribute as a female in computer science who is eager to learn by doing and wants to do whatever she is appointed to do. On a side note, I am very easy to talk to and have an overly optimistic personality. You will enjoy my presence, I guarantee that. That was confidence, not cockiness (: I should also throw in the fact that I always get my shit done when it needs to be done.

## Ronnie Bell 28/01/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I'm a classically trained scientist, strategic marketing professional, and full time collaborator. In short, I speak to both sides of the brain, while ensuring all partners at the table also receive airtime and air-cover.

I've worked on the biggest retail expansion in Canadian history - leading an unprecedented marketing/communications campaign which constantly evolved to account for operational pressures. 

I've consulted with a Big 4 firm to fortune 500 companies. Led a portfolio of nostalgic and loved brands to double digit growth. Drove continuous improvement processes across a lubrication supply chain for one of the largest oil & gas companies. But above all, I've been a relatable leader through each experience.

As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Waterloo in 2006-2007, I gained top scores from my class - what's more, it was a Friday 7pm-10pm section. 

As a coach of hockey and skating since 2000, I've honed skill for guiding and developing a class. 

And finally as a leader within a 40 person marketing team, I know that the best ideas are rarely ever generated from a "top down" perspective.

Ultimately, I'm keen on reconnecting with great thinking and passion Velocity provides, to nurture ideas and talent.

## Simon Coulson 03/02/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

Over the past 7 years at BlackBerry I’ve worked in the Product Development department. I was responsible for new technology development, such as the “carbon fiber” material that was used on the Bold 9900 and Q10 battery doors. I was also in charge of all luxury and special edition devices; such as the Porsche Design collaborations.

My daily responsibilities at BlackBerry were to act as the interface between the mechanical engineering and the industrial design teams, evaluating concepts and feasibility. As a result, I have a vast amount of knowledge of the entire product development process, from initial concept to post production. 

I was fortunate to work on nearly every BlackBerry device since the introduction of the Pearl. Due to the number of models and variants of devices that BlackBerry produced, I spent up to 25% of the year in Asia working on site with suppliers such as Foxconn, Quanta, and Samsung, to name a few.

## Rahul Dutta 17/03/2015 ##

How can you contribute to a Velocity startup?

I have recently worked on a feasibility project for Business course at Western, where we had to come up with a business venture, and decide if it is a feasible idea. We had to perform consumer research, industry research, identify competitors and our relative strengths and weaknesses, marketing strategy and financial statements for 3 years of operation. This project has allowed me to exercise and improve my teamwork, analytical, strategic and time management skills. But most importantly, it has shown me the functioning of a start up. I have learnt about the ups and downs of a start up and have vastly improved my knowledge of the entrepreneurial world.
I strongly believe with this experience and skills that I have acquired, I will be an asset at Velocity. Also, I am extremely passionate about business and entrepreneurship, and this attitude will be make me a quick learner.
