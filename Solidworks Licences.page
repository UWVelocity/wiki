##Solidworks Licences##

We have 5 copies of Solidworks Premium, 1 of simulation, 1 of electrical professional, and 1 of inspection that can be used by anyone in the Foundry.  These are enterprise licences so it’s on a first come first served basis.  And needless to say, if you’re not using it, close the program so someone else can use the licence.
 
To access these copies, download Solidworks as you would for a standalone version.
 
Open Solidworks and when it asks you for a licence number use:
 
9010011932333518246JJ548
 
That licence is an enterprise licence and Solidworks will ask you for the server address.  Use:
 
25734@sso-swn-ls.uwaterloo.ca

If you have any issues contact Peter Heuss at <peter.heuss@uwaterloo.ca>
