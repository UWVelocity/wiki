**Resources for determining salaries**

- [Average Starting Salaries]()
- Benchmarket (formerly TechEdge):http://www.benchmarket.ca/ This survey is one that is used by a lot of local start-ups and local high-tech companies. They recently have completed a tech survey for Communitech. I anticipate you would be able to purchase both their Tech report and the one for Communitech OR perhaps you can get the Communitech one free as a member.
 
 
2.    AON Radford Technology Survey:https://www.radford.com/home/surveys/gts/
·         This is a global based survey resource that completes market analysis comp surveys quarterly. They aren’t cheap, but can provide hands-on analysis as required – for a price! Larger high tech companies (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, etc.) tend to use Radford, but it will provide you with good data, including US data if needed. This was a key market source for us at RIM.
 
3.    Payscale:http://www.payscale.com/
·         You can get most data for free on this one and tailor it Ontario and local. The challenge with this one is that most of the data is self-report, despite the algorithms they highlight using. I will say though it does tend to be pretty accurate. It is a good “pulse” check resource. You can obtain further analysis at a cost
