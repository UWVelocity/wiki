From recent experiences, omitting the '200 University Avenue West' line will get you into trouble, because most formatted address forms seem to reject the 'Minota Hagey Residence' part, and redirect your mail to somewhere in Central Stores. Even on-campus will mail will have trouble, so make sure to include all lines carefully.
