**[Canada's Business Model Competition](http://www.bmccanada.ca/2015/01/announcing-canadas-business-model-competition-2015/)**

Student entrepreneurs from across Canada are invited to compete using Alex Osterwalder’s Business Model Canvas. This tool uses an approach driven by a question, hypothesis, and validation process to create innovative business models that solve real problems. Entrepreneurs will be judged on how well they ‘get out of the building’, find a problem, nail a solution, and incorporate feedback from customers. They will also be judged on how well they have adapted their concept to meet customer wants and needs.
