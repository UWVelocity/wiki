Business development related activities may include trade show registration, specialized service provider support, marketing communication, and other related activities. Other types of projects may be considered on a case-by-case basis provided that such projects can be directly attributed to attaining a near-term milestone which significantly advances the company's investigations of market demand or technological feasibility, de-risks the venture, or otherwise achieves a new objective which substantially improves the company's footing to move forward.
