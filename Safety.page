##Safety training for current UWaterloo students/staff or alumni with active WatIAM accounts
The following courses are required by anyone using the Velocity Science lab or Velocity Foundry lab/shop. They can be found on the [Safety Office's website](https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/training/training-programs).

1. WHMIS 2015 (SO2017) - Note: register as directed through LEARN and select EMPLOYEE, not the student version.
2. General Laboratory Safety (SO1010)

Anyone who is supervising a team member (volunteer, co-op, etc.) needs to take new online training.

For anyone working in either workspace with cryogenic liquids or compressed gases, ensure that a Velocity Science staff member is consulted prior to your work. An additional training module will also be required.

We require electronic records in the form of screen captures of the final screens of the online modules or a screen capture of the list of the completed courses from [MyHRInfo or the Safety Office](https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/training/training-records).
