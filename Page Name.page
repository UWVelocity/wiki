Make good things happen

You’re a maker, so we know these things are very important to you:

Make something beautiful - You see the art in everything, from controller logic to CSS.
Make something surprising – You love solving thorny problems so users experience something that seems like magic.
Make something meaningful - Know that what you’re building contributes to real relationships, culture and happiness — and even social broader impact through our partners like the David Suzuki Foundation!
Working closely with our tech founder, you’ll play a central role developing our web-based app in AngularJS. Even as you focus on the front-end, you should be comfortable jumping into Rails to add an API or write a MongoDB query.

Our tech stack is optimized for developer happiness! Familiarity with any of it will help us hit it off, but we’re sharp enough to know a great developer when we see one, regardless of the particular technologies they’ve used.
