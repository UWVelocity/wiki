#Something broken?
For building-related issues (laundry, kitchen appliances etc) during the work week, talk to Ruth Ann, your amazing housekeeper, or after hours contact [v1maint@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:v1maint@uwaterloo.ca).

(You can also use BufferBox, http://bufferbox.com/ -- there is a pick-up kiosk in the Student Life Centre. Currently, packages are delivered for free because of a promotion sponsored by Google; you have three days to pick up the package from the kiosk after being emailed your six-digit code.)

#Garbage pickups
First floor – Thursday  
Second floor – Wednesday  
Third floor – Tuesday  

#Kitchens
Before leaving the kitchen, you must put away your dishes (whether they’re clean or dirty) either in your cupboard or in your room. Your dishes should not be on the counter unless you’re in the kitchen. Kitchens are cleaned daily by Ruth Ann but it is not her responsibility to clean and put away your dishes. If your dishes are out, she will move them to a secure location and you will need to find her to retrieve them.  

#Residence Ambassadors
Each term we select four students to act as point people for VeloCity Residence. These ambassadors assist with residence events (Startup Weekend), assist with residence tours, assist in promoting VeloCity in classes and other opportunities on campus, and re-stocking supplies (coffeemaker, printer paper etc).

Past Ambassadors:

Spring 2013: Liubou, Michael Chang, Kyle, Neil, Alexandru Blidaru.
Winter 2013: ???
Fall 2012: Jinny Kim, Shan Lian, Anne Nguyen and Michael Shao.  

#Laundry
Peter Sobot (previous VeloCity resident) created a fantastic laundry system http://lndr.me. When you start laundry, send an email to ([washer1](mailto:washer1@lndr.me)/[water2](mailto:washer2@lndr.me)/[dryer1](mailto:dryer1@lndr.me)/[dryer2](mailto:dryer2@lndr.me))@lndr.me (whichever is applicable), or use the QR codes. You'll get an email as soon as your clothes are done and other residents will get to know when the machines are busy/free.  

#Devices in residence
If you would like to sign out a phone or tablet to use to test out your apps, find one of your Dons! Once you have signed out a device it is your responsibility. If it
goes missing or something happens to it, you will need to replace it. When you are finished with it, return it to the Don and sign the sign-out sheet.  

(This section is out of date as of Spring 2013, but is left here for posterity. If you need to borrow a device, ping your dons and/or the VeloCity team.)
