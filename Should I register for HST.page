Why register?

By not registering for an HST number you are guaranteed to get no more than $0.00 in a refund. By registering for an HST number you are guaranteed to get no less than $0.00 (if you spend more money than you collect). When you register for an HST number (which is free and really easy to do – XXX) you will submit an “HST return” on a quarterly basis* that lists all of the HST you paid and all of the HST you collected. Most times, a startup is spending more money than they are earning for the early stages. This means on a net basis you will also be in a refund position; when in a refund position, the CRA send you a cheque for the amount owed.

Ex. You buy $5,000 of computer equipment and pay $690 in HST. You use it to create something you sell for $1,000 and charge $113 in HST.
Your net amount is having paid (690-113) $577.00. If you have an HST number, you would submit your return and shortly after** get a cheque for $577.00.

I know what you’re thinking – You don’t want to have to ask customers for HST. I’ll leave you then with my last thought: if someone doesn’t want to buy your product or service because you’re charging HST, they don’t want it bad enough.

*quarterly is one installment option, you can set up different intervals of remittance if you’d like

**Shortly after depends on how busy the CRA but you can usually expect your refund in less than a couple months.
